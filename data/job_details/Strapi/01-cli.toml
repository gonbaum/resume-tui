Designed and built the **Strapi Cloud CLI** from the ground up — the primary developer interface for deploying and managing projects on Strapi Cloud.

- Architected the full CLI from scratch: command structure, auth flows, project linking, and deployment pipeline
- Integrated deeply with **Strapi v4** internals to support seamless local-to-cloud workflows
- Focused heavily on **developer experience (DX)**: clear error messages, minimal friction, sensible defaults

**Stack:** TypeScript · Node.js · Strapi v4
