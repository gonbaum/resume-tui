Founded **360panoramica**, a 360° immersive experience brand — overseeing everything from web design to photography, video editing, and 360° photo/video stitching.

Adopted 360° video early, well before artists like Björk and Tame Impala brought it to mainstream music videos.

Handled both the creative and technical sides: custom web presence, client production, and post-processing pipelines.
